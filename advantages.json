In its place, you possess a magical artifact, a gift from Jonah with unique abilities. You can spend a Hero Point to activate your object’s special ability, and it continues to function for the remainder of the Scene.[p]You should work with your GM to choose an appropriate artifact, but some examples are…[p]- A bronze-and-silver-colored spike covered in strange sigils and made of much harder material. Only as wide as a pike shaft, it replaces a leg and grows into the stump. It never tarnishes and can smash through even the thickest of doors. You can kick through the equivalent of a foot of solid wood effortlessly, and if you spend a Raise to kick another characte, he takes 1 more Wound than he would otherwise.[p]- A spyglass made from hollow bones and fitted with blue faceted gems. Only the gift giver can see through it like a normal spyglass, but it also lets her see through the sides of a ship or the walls of a building to see what is happening inside.[p]- A pair of boots made out of dried...leather. They never get wet and the wearer can walk on water or wet surfaces as if on dry land. Of course, if the wearer leans over into the water, his boots will continue to float while he falls into the water and potentially drowns.",

"advantage": "Seeker of Soryana",
"description": "You know the secret pathways to Soryana, the Isle of the Dead. When exploring the wilderness or sailing, you can spend a Hero Point to find Soryana and gain an audience with Locuo. You can plead your case before him, and if he finds your cause just he will grant you the companionship of an appropriate ancestor.[p]Your ancestor will follow you as a ghostly, translucent specter but interacts with the world the same as any living character (she can only walk across solid surfaces, she can lift and carry objects, etc.). She has her own free will, but will generally help you to achieve your goals. Typically, this means a Story, but some Seekers (or their ancestors) will return to Soryana earlier or later, depending on the circumstances.[p]Your ancestor has 3 Ranks in all Traits. You and the GM each choose 1 Background for your ancestor, granting her all the associated Advantages for that Background, as well as 2 Ranks in each Background’s Skills. Your ancestor can take 10 Wounds before her soul is unraveled and lost for eternity.[p]Your ancestor's tie on this world is tenuous. At the beginning of each game session, you must spend a Hero Point in order to maintain your connection to your ancestor and allow her to keep her grasp on her sanity. If you do not pay this cost (either because you choose not to, or because your ancestor has wandered away from you), you lose your tie with your ancestor and she becomes an angry, insane spirit Monster (Strength 10, Monster Qualities Destructive and Horrifying, and she keeps any Advantages she had before). Her connection to your Hero is broken, and she preys upon the living.[p]Locuo does not take lightly to Seekers who let their ancestors become Lost, and is unlikely to view future petitions from such characters in a favorable light. If your ancestor becomes Lost, you must either find and destroy him or discover a way to return his sanity before Locuo will grant you another ancestor’s aid.[p]This Advantage also allows you to serve as a guide for another character who wishes to visit Soryana and petition Locuo. In this case, the other character pays the Hero Point to maintain the connection, and the ancestor follows her rather than you. If a character that you guide to Soryana fails to uphold her connection or doesn’t return her ancestor to the island, the responsibility falls to you to correct this.",

Some examples include “I need help,” “I need to speak with you privately,” or “I am an agent of the Chapters,” as well as simple single-word phrases such as “yes,” “no,” “liar,” or “thief.” If the code contradicts words that are spoken, the other party will usually assume that the code is the truth.[p]You can teach another character how to make a single gesture in order to pass a message to a third party, but the character you teach cannot understand replies or use any phrases other than the one you show her. For this reason, most agents teach common phrases such as “I need to speak to you privately” or “I am carrying an important message” and, once they are free to speak more openly, they can then pass on more complex messages.",
